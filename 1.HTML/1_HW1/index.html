        <p>
          Mahatma Gandhi was born into a modest family in Gujarat. His father,
          Karamchand Gandhi, was a local official, and his mother, Putlibai, was
          deeply religious. Gandhi's upbringing was influenced by the principles
          of Jainism, emphasizing non-violence, fasting, and vegetarianism.

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <h3>Ahimsa (Nonviolence)</h3>
        <p>
          Gandhi's principles of non-violence and civil disobedience inspired
          millions in India and globally. He emphasized self-reliance,
          advocating for the use of khadi (hand-spun cloth) to promote economic
          independence.
        </p>
        <h3>Satyagraha (Truth Force)</h3>
        <p>
          Satyagraha is a philosophy and practice of nonviolent resistance
          developed by Mahatma Gandhi. Derived from Sanskrit, the term combines
          "Satya" (truth) and "Agraha" (firmness or insistence), meaning
          "holding firmly to the truth."
