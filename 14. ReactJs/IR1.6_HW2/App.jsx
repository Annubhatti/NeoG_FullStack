// 1. Create a React component called ReverseArray, which has a function to return the reversed array. Use reverse method to achieve that. 

// const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// 2. Create a React component called CalculateBMI, which has a function to calculate the bmi. BMI is calculated as weight divided by the square of height. Weight is 70 kg and height is 1.75 m.

// 3. Create a React component called GenerateQuote, which has a function to display random quote from a given array of quotes. 

//   const quotes = [

//       "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs",

//       "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. - Steve Jobs",

//       "Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life. - Steve Jobs",

//       "Stay hungry, stay foolish. - Steve Jobs",

//       "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. - Nelson Mandela",

//     ];

// 4. Create a React component called GradeAnalyser, which has a function that takes a student's score and displays a grade along with a corresponding message. Pass the score 85 as argument. Assume the grading scale is as follows:

// Score 90-100: A, "Excellent work!"

// Score 80-89: B, "Good job!"

// Score 70-79: C, "Not bad, keep it up!"

// Score 60-69: D, "You passed, but aim higher next time."

// Score below 60: F, "Sorry, you didn't pass. Keep working hard!"

// 5. Create a React component named TemperatureFeedback, which has a function that takes the current temperature  as parameter and provides feedback based on the temperature range. Take temperature as 25. Assume the following temperature categories:

// Temperature below 0: "Brr, it's freezing!"

// Temperature 0 to 10: "It's quite cold, bundle up!"

// Temperature 10 to 20: "The weather is cool and comfortable."

// Temperature 20 to 30: "It's a warm day!"

// Temperature above 30: "It's hot outside, stay cool!"

// Expected Output:


import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

    const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
